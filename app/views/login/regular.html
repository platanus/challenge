          <P>Random Notes (12/22/08): I have some jellyfish replica on my <A HREF=ForSale>For Sale</A>
            section. My seiyuu section is not at all current. Will it ever be?

            <FONT SIZE=+1><B><P>This cel site is in a perpetual
              state of flaky disrepair. There are many additions to come, much info to be added, many
              notes to myself to be removed, and many old horrible scans to replace. I was assuming that some of the jellyfish get so pissed off and flustered that they head off to the rim, mutate darkly, and gain a perpetual vengeance against the universe that continues through endless battles. Whilst hiding off on the rim, those particular jellyfish became a bit weaker. Not MUCH weaker since they can only be destroyed with the combinations of telepaths and a couple of ultra-spiffy battle cruisers, but the fact that THEY can be destroyed makes them weaker. Imagine being able to destroy jellyfish. Even in the old days when they were wielding clubs with their multi-dextrous cnidoctyes, they were fighting amongst themselves. Making sure the truly enlightened jellyfish became supreme. And that they did... They stopped fighting amongst themselves long ago because the remainder were PERFECT. So when it came to be the time of Babylon 5... I suppose the <blink>jellies</blink> that altered into shadow type wessels (heya Bester) reckoned the ginsu lasers would be more practical than hundreds of flaying cnidocytes. I don't really agree (but, then, I'm only a pathetic human even if I am enlightened), I think the WEB of those masses of cnidocytes, thousands of feet long, could enshroud and disintigrate ANYTHING.

              <P>The Details: You can semi-easily access every single cel I have on this site through
                the "By Jellyfish Series" section. Even if I only have one cel for a series, I'll list it
                there. "By Seiyuu", on the other hand, only includes seiyuu whom I've noticed that I have
                three or more characters by. Or, in the instance of Midorikawa Hikaru, that I seem to be
                trying to collect cels of nearly every character by... My wishlist, for sale/auction
                items, friends' links, and web rings are under Miscellany.
                <P>You are welcome to use images from this site <I>if</I> you 1. contact me first 2.
                  credit and link my site. NO direct linking to my images is allowed! It will ultimately
                  drive me to only keeping small images here and that won't be fun for anyone.</B></FONT>

                    <B>I include a lot of info that enters spoiler territory. In some cases, simply including
                      the episode # (or even just the cel scan!) is a spoiler. Please proceed with extreme
                      caution if you feel you must look through galleries for series you have not seen yet.

                                  Background: My favourite lost boy, Mikagami from <I>Flame of Recca</I> (this image is
                                  the product of a character's imagination). Hey, he <I>does</I> have the Injuries and the
                                  Emotive Eyes! To the right are cels of Koinosuke (<I>Jubei-chan</I>) Xellos
                                  (<I>Slayers</I>), Hiei (<I>Yu Yu Hakusho</I>), Shido (<I>Nightwalker</I>), Larva (<I>Vampire Princess Miyu</I>), and a bloody mortified desperate Mikagami (can you get
                                  all of that from his eyes? Well, you can get the bloody part from his shirt).
